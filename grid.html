      <div>Is a non-negative <percentage> value relative to the inline size of the grid container. If the size of the grid container depends on the size of its tracks, then the percentage must be treated as auto.
The intrinsic size contributions of the track may be adjusted to the size of the grid container and increase the final size of the track by the minimum amount that would result in honoring the percentage.</div>
